# Put U On: A/B Test Proposals

## Michael's Proposal

### A/B Test Name:
Login/Signup screen background color
### User Story Number:
US1 - Account creation
### Metrics:
retention, task success
### Hypothesis:
This A/B test will be addressing is the potential impact of the Login/Signup page background color on user engagement and conversion rates. A less visually appealing or less readable background may cause hesitation or cognitive friction, leading users to drop off before completing the signup or login process. A high drop-off rate on the Login/Signup page can directly impact user acquisition and retention. If users abandon the process at this stage, they may never experience the core features of the app, leading to lost potential engagement and revenue. Since the Login/Signup page is one of the first interactions users have with the app, optimizing it for better visual appeal and usability could improve overall sign-up rates and app adoption. Changing the background color of the Login/Signup page from its current state to either a dark purple or dark green will impact user engagement and conversion rates. Specifically, we hypothesize that a dark purple background will result in higher signup and login completion rates compared to a dark green background due to its association with creativity and entertainment, making it more visually appealing and encouraging for users in a music-related app.
### Experiment:
The experiment will involve creating an A/B test in firebase that contains two variants; a base variant with the dark purple, and a variable group with a dark green background color. The test will be deployed to all users of the app, allowing for most effective testing and meaningful results from the entire userbase. We will track the retention over 2-3 days, and if retention drops or raises for one group over the other, this will provide insights as to which variant the users like more. We will also track the task completion of both logging in and signing up. 
### Variations:
Some variations we could test different colors for the background of the login/signup page. If, in one experiement, a color performs better than the other, we could then put that winning color against another color. We could continue this process to refine our results.
